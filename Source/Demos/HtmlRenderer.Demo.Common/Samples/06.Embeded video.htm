        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Embeded video is an 'iframe' with 'src' pointing to the video hosted on the server.<br />
                Obviously the Html Renderer doesn't support iframes so don't expect to see ActiveX
                in the control that will stream the video, but the video thumbnail image, caption
                string and play visualization is shown. Clicking on it will open the video
                page on its site.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How does it works
            </h3>
            <div>
                The id of the video is extracted from the 'src' URL and using the server API gets
                the video data is extracted: thumbnail image url, caption string and link url.<br />
                Then, on the video frame location, the thumbnail image is shown with the caption
                on top and a nice play button in the middle.<br />
                When the user clicks on the video frame a link click events occures that opens the
                actual video page, instead of video source.
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>Note: </b>Because this technique requires server API it is currently supported
                only for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/">
