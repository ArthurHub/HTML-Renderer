# HTML and CSS Support

## HTML and CSS specification

* HTML 4.01
* CSS level 2

## Additional features

Jose took the liberty of adding a couple of features:

* Background gradients
* Rounded corners

These are achieved thru the following CSS properties:

* `background-gradient: (color)`
* `background-gradient-angle: (number)`
* `corner-ne-radius: (length)`
* `corner-nw-radius: (length)`
* `corner-se-radius: (length)`
* `corner-se-radius: (length)`
* `corner-radius: (length){1,4} (shorthand for all corners)`
